# üéì Academic Assistant (Personal Project)

## üìñ Description
**Personalised Academic Assistant using Agentic AI**  
This project is an AI-driven academic assistant that generates **personalised study plans, structured notes, and strategic learning advice**.  
It coordinates multiple agents through a **ReAct-based decision-making loop** using the `gpt-oss-20b` model (or OpenAI GPT-4 alternative) and leverages **LangGraph** for workflow orchestration.
